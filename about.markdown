Hi! I am a&nbsp;high school student from [Ostrava, Czech
Republic](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ostrava,+Czech+Republic/@49.8786272,16.9643538,6z/),
who enjoys both the theory and the practice of computer programming.

## Basic information

My name is Jan Špaček /jan ʃpatʃɛk/. You can find me on GitHub as
[@honzasp](https://github.com/honzasp) or you can [send me an
email](mailto:patek.mail@gmail.com).

## Work

There is a list of some projects I have done that do not fit in the [playground
section](/playground.html) of this site. Unfortunately, most of them are only
available in Czech.

- [Website of Eva Špačková](http://homel.vsb.cz/~spa184/). I created the whole
  site using Jekyll and it is continually maintained and updated.

- [A paper about functional programming](http://honzasp.github.io/funsp/), which
  participated in a Czech competition [SOČ](http://www.soc.cz).

- [A biochemistry project](/files/glucosis.pdf) about glucose -- glycolysis,
  glycogenesis and citric-acid cycle, where I described the enzymes and
  processes involved in those crucial metabolic pathways.

- [A wall](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wb9uheey5r2jttf/AABkPH25sypsLGRuPEqaKGx6a)
    in our school. I designed and created the whole painting, mostly in my free
    time, in May and June 2013.

## Competitions

There are some contest where I competed with good results. This list contains
only those places which can be considered to be successes. Some of the
competitions were regional (Czech regions have about 1&nbsp;M people) and some
national. Most of the contests are recognized by Czech Ministry of Education
([MŠMT](http://www.msmt.cz)).
