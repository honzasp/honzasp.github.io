  <p>This demo is a&nbsp;simulation of particles that move around, attracted by
    static wells. The inspiration for this came from <a
      href="http://www.andrew-hoyer.com/experiments/particle_system">Andrew
      Hoyer</a>.</p>

  <p>Particles were my first serious use of HTML Canvas and are thus very, very
    old. The code and the physics are trivial, yet it was still very educational
    for me at the time.</p>
