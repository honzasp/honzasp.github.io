This demo is a simulation of particles that move around, attracted by static
wells. The inspiration for this came from [Andrew
Hoyer](http://www.andrew-hoyer.com/experiments/particle_system).

Particles were my first serious use of HTML Canvas and are thus very, very old.
The code and the physics are trivial, yet it was still very educational for me
at the time.
