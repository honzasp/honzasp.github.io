          <h2>Work experience</h2>
          <dl>
            <dt>Kiwi.com (summer 2016)</dt>
            <dd>I participated in developing an improved engine for combining
            flights, my chief responsibility was the clustering and networking
            code in Python using asyncio. I also designed and developed
            a&nbsp;custom database to store our terabyte-scale datasets across
            many machines in the cloud, able to handle hundreds of requests per
            second with marginal (mostly network-bound) latency.</dd>

            <dt>Bileto Technologies (summer 2015)</dt>
            <dd>I co-developed a public transport routing engine in C++.
            State-of-the-art algorithms with some novel optimizations were
            necessary to respond to queries on dense country-sized networks in a
            few hundred milliseconds. The engine communicates with other cloud
            services.</dd>

            <dt>Adash (fall 2014&mdash;spring 2015)</dt>
            <dd>I developed an application for visualization of machine vibration (the
            method of animated deflection shapes). The vibration data come from
            Adash tools and the application is closely integrated with other
            company products. This program was developed in C++ using wxWidgets
            and primarily targets Windows, but it also works on Linux..</dd>

          <h2>Open-source projects</h2>
          <dl>
            <dt>Spiral (a programming language) (2015)</dt>
            <dd>Spiral is a simple functional language inspired by Scheme. It
            has first-class functions, tail-calls, module system, both mutable
            and immutable data structures and a mark-and-sweep garbage
            collector. Compilation is separated into multiple stages using two
            intermediate languages.  I implemented the compiler and wrote
            a&nbsp;paper about it as my maturita (high-school leaving exam)
            task.  The compiler is written in Rust and the runtime in C++.</dd>

            <dt>libext2 (2016)</dt>
            <dd>libext2 is a Rust library for manipulating ext2 filesystems. It
            supports all common filesystem operations (both reading and writing)
            and integrates a FUSE interface.  This was my first semestral
            program at the university.</dd>

            <dt>Krt (2014)</dt>
            <dd>A game running in browser written in CoffeeScript, using modern
            Web APIs. Up to four players control circular vehicles and shoot
            each other in a procedurally generated system of caves.</dd>

            <dt>Totem Destroyer (2009)</dt>
            <dd>A game inspired by a well-known Flash game, written in C++ using
            SDL with OpenGL for 2D graphics and Box2D for realistic
            physics. The player has to carefully destroy all blocks of a
            "totem" and prevent precious idols from hitting the ground.</dd>
