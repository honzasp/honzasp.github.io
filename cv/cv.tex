I am Jan Špaček. My experience includes:
\begin{compactitem}
  \item High-performance distributed systems
  \item Deep learning
  \item Web applications
  \item Desktop applications
  \item Physically-based rendering
  \item Programming language implementations
\end{compactitem}

\section*{Work experience}

\textbf{Corona Renderer} (Prague, 2017–2019)
  \newline Integration of Corona Renderer into ARCHICAD.
  \newline Bachelor thesis supervised by Jaroslav Křivánek, defended in 2018.
  \newline Written in C++ for Windows, using ARCHICAD APIs and Corona API.

\textbf{Kiwi.com} (Brno, 2016, 2017)
  \newline Design and development of a custom distributed in-memory database
  with low latency and high throughput for storing flight combinations.
  \newline Development of an engine for distributed routing of flights.
  \newline Design and development of a distributed system for high-throughput
  reading of flights from Cassandra by directly reading the internal database
  representation.
  \newline C++, Python with asyncio, using Cassandra, Redis, PostgreSQL, and
  docker.

\textbf{Bileto} (Prague, 2015)
  \newline Development of an engine for real-time routing in public transport
    networks.
  \newline C++, using Redis and PostgreSQL.

\textbf{Adash} (Ostrava, 2014–2015)
  \newline Development of ADS, an application to visualize measured vibrations
  of industrial machinery.
  \newline Design of efficient digital filters accelerated using advanced
  features of ARM processors.
  \newline C++, wxWidgets.


\section*{Selected projects}

\textbf{SkyGAN} (2019–2020)
  \newline Generating high-resolution skydome images with deep learning
  (generative adversarial networks).
  \newline Master thesis supervised by David Futschik and Alexander Wilkie.
  \newline Python with PyTorch

\textbf{Dancerank.cz} (2016–)
  \newline A database of results of dance sport competitions from several
  countries (including Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Polish and international
  events).
  \newline Detailed analysis of competition results, ranking of couples, public API.
  \newline Predictions of future competition results with a novel machine learning model.
  \newline Advanced search with a custom text-search service.
  \newline Python with asyncio, using MongoDB and Redis.

\textbf{dort} (2016–2017)
  \newline A physically based renderer heavily influenced by pbrt.
  \newline C++, Lua

\textbf{spiral} (2015)
  \newline Full implementation of a dynamic compiled programming language: a
  compiler, a runtime support library with garbage collection and a standard
  library of basic algorithms and data structures.
  \newline Conducted as a high-school final project; the standard library was
  later extended as part of a course at university.
  \newline C++, Rust, x86 assembler, Spiral.

\ldots{}and a large amount of smaller projects, a few of them are on my GitHub

\section*{Skills}

I am not limited to any particular language, platform or environment. I am most
experienced in C++ and Python, but I also wrote Rust,
{\small Haskell, C\#, Lua,}
{\footnotesize JavaScript,}
{\scriptsize Clojure, Ocaml, Go, Java, my own language Spiral, ...}

I happened to develop software mostly for Linux servers and Windows desktops. I
(ab)used many databases (MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, ...), countless libraries,
frameworks, and APIs. I also enjoy low-level programming, such as bare metal
Beaglebone and Arduino, CUDA, or SIMD programming with SSE/AVX. My editor is
Vim.

I have solid background in computer science from Matfyz:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Bachelor (Bc.) (2015–2018, with honors): general computer science
\item Master (Mgr.) (2018–2020, \textit{not yet finished}): artificial intelligence
\end{compactitem}

Beside computer science, I dance Latin on a competition level (with my partner
we have the highest national class ``A''). I am also an avid reader in English and
Czech.
