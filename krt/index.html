  <p><strong>Krt</strong> is one of the largest JavaScript-based games I have
    made.  Players engage in a&nbsp;battle of circular tanks, shooting both the
    opponents to receive points and the blocky surroundings to supply them with
    energy and mass vital for survival.</p>

  <p>The game makes use of many cutting-edge Web APIs, notably Audio API and
    Web Workers, to get as much as possible from modern browsers.</p>

  <p>Of possible interest is also the game physics, detecting and solving the
    collisions of the grid and the objects, and the noise algorithm used to
    generate unlimited amount of random maps. This algorithm can be executed
    in a&nbsp;background thread, speeding up the game initialization.</p>
