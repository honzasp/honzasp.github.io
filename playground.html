<p>Through the years, I created many toy projects and experiments to check out
  new ideas, algorithms and technologies. I considered some of them interesting
  enough to justify posting them online.</p>

<h2>Web (JavaScript)</h2>

<p>There are some little apps powered by client-side scripting in JavaScript
  (and CoffeeScript). Most of them were made to try the (then) new browser APIs,
  like <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> or Audio API. By a&nbsp;strange coincidence,
  they are mostly games.</p>

<div class="gallery">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="item">
      <h3><a href="/krt">Krt</a></h3>
      <a href="/krt"><img src="/img/thumb_krt.png" width="200" height="123"
        alt="Krt"></a>

      <p>This is the biggest one with the largest amount of man-hours invested.
        Up to four players control their circular vehicles in two-dimensional
        cave system made from thousands of blocks and try to destroy
        opponents.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="item">
      <h3><a href="/fishy">Fishy</a></h3>
      <a href="/fishy"><img src="/img/thumb_fishy.png" width="200" height="123"
        alt="Fishy"></a>

      <p>Remake of a&nbsp;famous Flash game in JavaScript. Eat the smaller fish
        and avoid the bigger ones to dominate the food chain in the pond.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="item">
      <h3><a href="/particles">Particles</a></h3>
      <a href="/particles"><img src="/img/thumb_particles.png" width="200" height="123"
        alt="Particles"></a>

      <p>A&nbsp;few physics rules, simple code, but quite an interesting result
        (at least, 14-years-old me really enjoyed this).</p>
