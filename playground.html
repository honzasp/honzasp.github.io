<p>Through the years, I created many toy projects and experiments to check out
  new ideas, algorithms and technologies. I considered some of them interesting
  enough to justify posting them online.</p>

<h2 id="web-javascript">Web (JavaScript)</h2>

<p>There are some little apps powered by client-side scripting in JavaScript
  (and CoffeeScript). Most of them were made to try the (then) new browser APIs,
  like <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> or Audio API. By a&nbsp;strange coincidence,
  they are mostly games.</p>

      </a>

      <p>This is the biggest one with the largest amount of man-hours invested.
        Up to four players control their circular vehicles in two-dimensional
        cave system made from thousands of blocks and try to destroy
        opponents.</p>

      <p>Remake of a&nbsp;famous Flash game in JavaScript. Eat the smaller fish
        and avoid the bigger ones to dominate the food chain in the pond.</p>

      <p>A&nbsp;few physics rules, simple code, but quite an interesting result

<h2 id="offline-github-repos">Offline (GitHub repos)</h2>

<p>Even though the JavaScript apps are usually more attractive, I also spent
  time on other, less visually-intensive programs and algorithms. The most
  interesting can be found on <a href="https://github.com/honzasp">my
    GitHub</a>, and here is a short list:</p>

<ul class="repos">
  <li>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/honzasp/krunimir">Krunim√≠r</a></h3>

    <p>This is an implementation of the task from the Czech Programming
      Competition in 2010. We were presented with the problem of implementing
      a simple procedural Logo-based programming language for generation of
      turtle graphics. Having won the competition thanks to my use of
      <code>eval</code>, I decided to solve the task once again, using proper
      compilation techniques.</p>

    <p>Input programs are parsed using <a
        href="https://github.com/nathansobo/treetop">Treetop</a>, a
      parser-generator library for Ruby. The resulting AST is then compiled into
      &bdquo;bytecode&ldquo;, which is then interpreted by a&nbsp;stack-based
      virtual machine.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/honzasp/inkvizitor">Inkvizitor</a></h3>

    <p>Inkvizitor is a simple program to manage lists of debtors. The killer
      feature is the ability to automatically export GPS coordinates
      corresponding to the people's addresses using <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/">Google's
        Geocoding</a> API. It was my first larger program written in Haskell and
      using GUI with library <a
        href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/WxHaskell">wxHaskell</a>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/honzasp/ropucha">Ropucha</a></h3>

    <p>Ropucha is a programming language used to generate <code>.tsk</code>
      programs to control robots from the company Robotis. There is a pseudo-IDE
      available, which can be used to produce those programs, but the interface
      is graphical and the language quite primitive, so I created a simple
      (textual) programming language called Ropucha that transpiles to the
      <code>.tsk</code> format.</p>

    <p>The transpiler is written in Ruby and was developed using <a
        href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> and <a
        href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a>. It is not very well-designed, but
      the translated language features high-level hardware access, advanced
      arithmetic, rich control structures and functions. The language has
      slightly unusual syntax, as it is the only programming language I know
      that allows whitespace in identifiers.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/honzasp/balloon_watcher">Balloon
        watcher</a></h3>

    <p>This is the application you would use if you wanted to hang a smartphone
      with Android to a balloon and let it fly. The app can take logs with
      information about position and phone state, send those logs via SMS so
      that you can track the balloon and take photos during the flight. It may
      also be controlled remotely using SMS messages.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the app never found its use in a real flight, since the
      plan with making and sending the balloon failed.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/honzasp/totem_destroyer">Totem
        destroyer</a></h3>

    <p>A two-dimensional game written in C++ using <a
        href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a> with OpenGL for rendering, and <a
        href="http://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> for physics.  The player has to
      carefully destroy blocks from a totem, so that precious idols do not hit
      the ground. I made the game when I was 13 and was inspired by a similar
      Flash game.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/honzasp/typing">Typing</a></h3>

    <p>Haskell implementations of some type-checkers from <a
        href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Types and Programming
        Languages</a> by B. C. Pierce. The most advanced is System F<sub>&omega;</sub>
      with subtyping and many extensions, such as records and variants.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/honzasp/radon">Radon</a> and <a
        href="https://github.com/honzasp/zinc">Zinc</a></h3>

    <p>Implementations of two dynamic programming languages inspired by Lisp.
      Radon is compiled into x86 assembler and runs with a small runtime written
      in C and assembly. Garbage collector is not yet implemented, so the
      programs can easily exhaust memory, and the code generator is quite naive.
      The compiler itself is written in Rust.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Zinc is an interpreter written in Haskell, but the
      features of the language are quite similar to Radon. The syntax is a bit
      nicer and it also supports writable variables.</p>
