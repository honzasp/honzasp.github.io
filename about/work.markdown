There is a list of some projects I have done that do not fit in the [lab
section](/lab) of this site. Unfortunately, most of them are only available in
Czech.

- [Adash ADS](http://www.adash.com/) is an application for visualization of
  machine vibration (the method of animated deflection shapes). The user defines
  a simplified model of the machine and exports the definition into a measuring
  device. Then they download the results back to the PC and can analyze the
  vibrations in detail. This program was developed in C++ using wxWidgets.

- [Compiler for a simple functional
  language](https://github.com/honzasp/spiral). The text of the corresponding
  paper is available [in Czech](/files/spiral_cs.pdf) and [in
  English](/files/spiral_en.pdf). I implemented the compiler and wrote the paper
  as my maturita (high-school leaving exam) task.

- [Website of Špačekprojekt, s. r. o.](http://wp.spacekprojekt.cz). This website
  uses Wordpress, various plugins and a custom theme.

- [Website of Eva Špačková](http://homel.vsb.cz/~spa184/). I created the whole
  site using Jekyll and it is continually maintained and updated.

- [A biochemistry project](/files/glucosis.pdf) about glucose -- glycolysis,
  glycogenesis and citric-acid cycle, where I described the enzymes and
  processes involved in those crucial metabolic pathways.

- [A wall](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wb9uheey5r2jttf/AABkPH25sypsLGRuPEqaKGx6a)
    in our school. I designed and created the whole painting, mostly in my free
    time, in May and June 2013.
