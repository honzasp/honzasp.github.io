I worked for some companies as a&nbsp;programmer:

- I participated on the development of a public transport routing engine for
  [Bileto](http://bileto.com), which must be able to route on country-sized
  networks in a&nbsp;few hundred milliseconds. We implemented state-of-the-art
  algorithms and added some new optimizations. The engine is written in C++ and
  communicates with other services in the cloud.

- [Adash ADS](http://www.adash.com/) is an application for visualization of
  machine vibration (the method of animated deflection shapes). The user defines
  a simplified model of the machine and exports the definition into a measuring
  device. Then they download the results back to the PC and can analyze the
  vibrations in detail. This program was developed in C++ using wxWidgets.

(Please see [the lab](/lab) for my personal (and open-source) programming projects.)

I have also worked on some projects that are not connected with programming.
Unfortunately, most of them are only available in Czech.

- [Website of Špačekprojekt, s. r. o.](http://wp.spacekprojekt.cz). This website
  uses Wordpress, various plugins and a custom theme.

- [Website of Eva Špačková](http://homel.vsb.cz/~spa184/). I created the whole
  site using Jekyll and it is continually maintained and updated.

- [A biochemistry project](/files/glucosis.pdf) about glucose -- glycolysis,
  glycogenesis and citric-acid cycle, where I described the enzymes and
  processes involved in those crucial metabolic pathways.

- [A wall](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wb9uheey5r2jttf/AABkPH25sypsLGRuPEqaKGx6a)
    in our school. I designed and created the whole painting, mostly in my free
    time, in May and June 2013.
