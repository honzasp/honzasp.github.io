I worked for some companies as a&nbsp;programmer:

- Summer 2016: I worked as a backend developer for
  [Kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com) (formerly Skypicker), designing and
  developing the search engine. We improved the algorithms for combining the
  flights and created a&nbsp;custom clustered database to accelerate the search.
  Both projects were developed in a mixture of C++ and Python with asyncio.

- Summer 2015: I participated on the development of a public transport routing
  engine for [Bileto](http://bileto.com), which must be able to route on
  country-sized networks in a&nbsp;few hundred milliseconds. We implemented
  state-of-the-art algorithms and added some new optimizations. The engine is
  written in C++ and communicates with other services in the cloud.

- Fall 2014 &ndash; Spring 2015: [Adash ADS](http://www.adash.com/) is an
  application for visualization of machine vibration (the method of animated
  deflection shapes). The user defines a simplified model of the machine and
  exports the definition into a measuring device. Then they download the results
  back to the PC and can analyze the vibrations in detail. This program was
  developed in C++ using wxWidgets. 

(Please see [the lab](/lab) for my personal open-source programming projects.)

I have also created some websites (only available in Czech):

- [Website of Špačekprojekt, s. r. o.](http://www.spacekprojekt.cz). This website
  uses Wordpress, various plugins and a custom theme.

- [Website of Eva Špačková](http://homel.vsb.cz/~spa184/). I created the whole
  site using Jekyll and it is continually maintained and updated.
