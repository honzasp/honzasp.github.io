<p>Through the years, I created many toy projects and experiments to check out
  new ideas, algorithms and technologies. I considered some of them interesting
  enough to justify posting them online.</p>

<ul class="crossroad">
  <li><a href="/lab/browser.html">Browser lab</a> contains experiments that run
    in the browser, utilizing Canvas or other modern APIs.</li>
  <li><a href="/lab/offline.html">Offline lab</a> comprises programs written for
    operating systems and usually controlled from the command line.</li>
</ul>
